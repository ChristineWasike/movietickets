              A release date for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 on Blu-ray has been posted online, letting fans know they can pick up Marvel’s latest hit in about two months. The highly-anticipated sequel kicked off the 2017 summer movie season with a bang, raking
              in $146.5 million in its opening weekend. To date, James Gunn’s film has grossed $374.8 million domestically and $844.3 million worldwide, easily surpassing the numbers posted by its predecessor. It’s no surprise Marvel is already putting
              the pieces together for a third film in their space opera series...<a href="http://screenrant.com/guardians-galaxy-2-blu-ray-release-date/">more</a>

              Ah, poor Colin Trevorrow. His 2012 feature film Safety Not Guaranteed was hailed as an off-beat indie delight, and his follow up Jurassic World regarded as a more-than- competent blockbuster. But his latest offering, The Book of Henry, may well have fans
              worrying about the fate of Star Wars Episode IX. The film, by all accounts, is a truly terrible turkey, and a strong contender for the worst movie of 2017...<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/earth-book-henry-really-worst-film-year/">more</a>

              On what would've been Tupac Shakur's 46th birthday, Lionsgate-Codeblack released the long-gestating biopic “All Eyez on Me" pulling an estimated $27.1 million in its debut weekend. Though only a third-place finish, it far surpassed analyst expectations
              of $17 million to $20 million, an unsurprising feat considering the industry's historical inability to properly track films targeting black audiences...<a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-june-tupac-biopic-all-eyez-on-me-1497821108-htmlstory.html">more</a>

              If lesbian characters show up in mainstream films, it’s often in small parts, either as butch stereotypes (Sisters, Pitch Perfect) or creepy predators (Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates). Sometimes, they’re a phantom presence, reflected in insults made
              about two straight women (Bridesmaids). Perhaps that’s what makes the new comedy Rough Night so refreshing: It’s the rare studio film to have not one but two queer characters in leading roles—and even better, they feel like real people...

              The big winner is Disney and Pixar’s “Cars 3,” which is speeding to $53.5 million from 4,256 locations, putting it in first place. That’s a lower opening than “Cars” ($60.1 million) and “Cars 2” ($66.1 million), but still enough to win the weekend. The
              first two “Cars” movies combined have made more than $435 million in the U.S. and $1 billion globally. The “Cars” films are far from Disney and Pixar’s highest earners, but “Cars 3” is another example that even a decent opening for the duo
              is a victory in the big picture...<a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/box-office-cars-3-all-eyez-on-me-rough-night-47-meters-down-1202469776/">more</a>

              In an interview last April, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said that Sony Pictures’ Venom and Silver and Black films would not be connected to Marvel Cinematic Universe or to their version of Spider-Man. Director Jon Watts, who will helm the wall-crawler’s
              first MCU solo film, also insisted that Venom would not be connected to the MCU at all. However, while in an interview Filmstarts, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Venom producer Amy Pascal said that Venom and Silver and Black would take place
              in the same universe as Spider-Man: Homecoming, which would mean they also take place in the MCU...<a href="http://www.cbr.com/spider-man-homecoming-same-universe-as-venom/">more</a>
